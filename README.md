This is an activity for my Level Design subject.

With one of my colleagues, we designed a level for a 3D single game, which we also had to write a GDD just for this prototype only.

- Check *A1 - LD Protoype* to see the actual activity request's.
- Check *LD_P1_LDD* to read the results of the level design.
- Check *LD_P1_GDD* to understand the game which the LDD is based on.
